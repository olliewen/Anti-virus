Why Use XShot Anti-Virus?

XShot Anti-virus helps protect your PC against malware (malicious software) like viruses, spyware and other potentially unwanted software. Malware can infect your PC without your knowledge: it might install itself from an email message, when you connect to the Internet or when you install certain applications using a USB flash drive, CD, DVD or other removable media. Some malware can also be programmed to run at unexpected times, not just when it's installed.

Windows Defender is included with Windows and helps keep malware from infecting your PC in two ways:
Providing real-time protection. Windows Defender notifies you when malware tries to install itself or run on your PC. It also notifies you when applications try to change important settings.
Providing any-time scanning options. You can use Windows Defender to scan for malware that might be installed on your PC, to schedule scans on a regular basis, and to automatically remove (or temporarily quarantine) anything that's detected during a scan.

When you use XShot Anti-virus, it's important to have up-to-date definitions. Definitions are files that act like an ever-growing encyclopaedia of potential software threats. XShot Anti-virus uses definitions to detect any malware and to notify you of potential risks. To help keep your definitions up to date, XShot Anti-virus works with XShot Update to automatically install new definitions as they're released. You can also have XShot Update check online for updated definitions before scanning.
